# @rollup/plugin-babel

üç£ A Rollup plugin for seamless integration between Rollup and Babel.

## Why?

If you're using Babel to transpile your ES6/7 code and Rollup to generate a standalone bundle, you have a couple of options:

- run the code through Babel first, being careful to exclude the module transformer, or
- run the code through Rollup first, and _then_ pass it to Babel.

Both approaches have disadvantages ‚Äì in the first case, on top of the additional configuration complexity, you may end up with Babel's helpers (like `classCallCheck`) repeated throughout your code (once for each module where the helpers are used). In the second case, transpiling is likely to be slower, because transpiling a large bundle is much more work for Babel than transpiling a set of small files.

Either way, you have to worry about a place to put the intermediate files, and getting sourcemaps to behave becomes a royal pain.

Using Rollup with `@rollup/plugin-babel` makes the process far easier.

## Requirements

This plugin requires an [LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) Node version (v10.0.0+) and Rollup v
